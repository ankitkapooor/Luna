To run the chatbot locally, a few python libraries may need to be installed using the following commands:

	pip install nltk
	pip install SpeechRecognition
	pip install pipwin
	pipwin install PyAudio
	pip install pyttsx3

The python files need to be executed in the followin order:

	python luna_nn.py

To successfully run Luna, make sure all the files are located in the same folder.
